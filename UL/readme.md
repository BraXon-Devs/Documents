# Usability Lead

The core skill sets needed in a web site development team are:
The usability lead’s role is to shape the overall user experience. The usability lead works closely with the information architect—in fact, the same individual often fills both information architect and usability roles. As the primary user advocate on the development team, the usability lead has responsibility for user testing, user research and persona development, and universal usability standards for the site project. In the initial stages of design, the usability lead is responsible for running interviews, field studies, and usability tests and for producing personas and scenarios to inform project requirements. Once designs are conceptualized in the form of diagrams, wireframes, and prototypes, the usability lead tests the designs with users and gathers feedback for the site designers and developers. In the final stages of a project, the usability lead evaluates the effectiveness of designs through additional field studies and user testing and ensures that universal usability goals are met. The usability lead is also responsible for evaluating the success of the project (Does the site accomplish the goals? Are users successful and satisfied with the design?) and for measuring project outcomes (Are more users visiting the site? Is the site producing more revenue?).
