# Web Tech Lead

The web tech lead must have a broad grasp of web publishing environments, development languages and web development frameworks, web database options, and network technology. The technology lead acts as the bridge, translator, and plain-English communicator between the technologists and the creative and project management elements of the team.

As part of the site planning process the technology lead creates the general blueprints for the collection of technologies that will support the chosen web site technology framework, including content management, rss (Really Simple Syndication) or other xml (Extensible Markup Language) content formats, database integration and support, custom web programming, and integration with other applications or databases that supply content or interactive features to the web site. The technology lead provides the primary data-processing architecture for the project, determining the technical specifications for the overall [web development framewor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_framework)k, assessing the developing strategy and goals, and matching those needs to appropriate technology solutions. In larger projects the web technology lead typically manages teams of programmers, network or server engineers, database administrators, software quality assurance testers, and other information technology professionals that support the production and design teams.
