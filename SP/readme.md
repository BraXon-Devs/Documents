# Site Production Lead

Early in the design stage the site production lead is responsible for converting initial web site page mockups, designs, and wireframes into html pages. Once the site has been planned and the design and information architecture plans have been completed, the site production lead manages the work of building the site’s pages, either directly in “plain” html or within a [web content management system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_content_management_system) (cms) or using web site production software such as Adobe Dreamweaver. In coordination with the site technical team, the site production lead is typically responsible for creating the master page templates in xhtml (Extensible HyperText Markup Language) and [Cascading Style Sheets](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets) (css), validating page code, and assembling the work of the information architects and site graphic designers into finished page templates ready to be filled with content. If a cms is used to deliver the finished content, the html/css page templates must be converted into the required format. In larger projects the site production lead usually manages a staff of web designers who fill pages with content, integrating finished text, graphics, and audiovisual elements on each page and linking pages to the larger web site and (usually) to other web pages on the Internet. In many web teams the site production lead also manages the work of site editors and copywriters.
